# Bernoulli-Polynomial
Visualization of Bernoulli-Polynomial on unit interval based on formulas found in Koecher M. (1987) Perlen der elementaren Analysis. In: Klassische elementare Analysis. Birkh√§user, Basel.  Note that the implementation is not efficient w.r.t. number of operations but can serve as an instructive illustration.
